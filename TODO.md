TODO List
=========

1. DONE: Familiarize yourself with the code (and the article).
2. DONE: Convert code to Python3.
3. Fix class names and function names per PEP.
4. Add comments to functions and classes.
5. In addition to VMD output (as currently written), output JSON file for use
   in 3Dmol.js.
6. Pyodide testing in browser.
7. Writing manuscript.
8. Does BINANA renumber residues and atoms? If it does, it would be good to
   change it so it does not renumber things.
9. Consider applying Binana to all the complexes of the BindingDB.

Need to make better examples. And also some sort of unit test.

When time comes, need to put notice on sourceforge saying the latest version is here.
